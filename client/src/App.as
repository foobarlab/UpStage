/**
 * @mainpage UpStage Documentation
 * UpStage release 1.9 -
 *
 *
 * A student team has contributed to the UpStage project as part of their final
 * year project
 * 
 * 
 * On a user level the following new features have changed from the
 * Upstage-2004-09-28.tar.gz release
 * + Upstage now renders to 320x200 not 320x240.
 *   This gets around layout problems when users have many toolbars installed
 *   in their browsers.
 * + A new /command has been added /wh or /whisper which allows players to send
 *   private messages to each other no matter which stage the player may reside
 *   on.
 * + Fonts are now embedded in the swf to provide a consistent layout no matter
 *   what the operating system or browser may be.
 * + The avatars are now selected from a scrollbar rather than a wardrobe which
 *   makes names eaisier to read & allows more possible avatars on a stage.
 * + Props and backdrop names now appear on mouse over to make things easier to
 *   read
 * + Misc bugs relating to syncronisation of all clients have been fixed.
 * + Avatar voices now overlap.  When more than four avatars attempt to speak
 *   at the same time, the voice with the least left to say is preempted
 * + Current player & audience count are displayed on screen
 * 
 * On a developer level, the entire client side code (ActionScript1) has been
 * rebuilt using ActionScript2 and the Model/View/Controller pattern
 * 
 *
